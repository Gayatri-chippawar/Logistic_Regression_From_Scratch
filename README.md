# 🚀 Logistic Regression From Scratch (Python)
📌 Overview
This project implements Logistic Regression from scratch using NumPy, without relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. It focuses on understanding the core mathematics behind binary classification.

✨ Features
🔢 Binary classification using Logistic Regression

🧮 Manual implementation of:
Sigmoid function
Gradient Descent
Weight & bias updates

🔍 Prediction on new input data
🎯 Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

🛠️ Technologies Used
🐍 Python
🔢 NumPy
📊Sklearb
📓 Jupyter Notebook
📊 Dataset

A binary classification dataset (e.g., medical / diabetes dataset) containing multiple features and target labels (0 or 1).

⚙️ How It Works
⚡ Initialize weights and bias
➕ Compute linear combination
📈 Apply sigmoid activation
📉 Calculate loss
🔁 Update parameters using gradient descent
✅ Predict class labels

▶️ How to Run
Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells

🧪 Output
The model predicts whether the input belongs to:

❌ Class 0 (Negative)
✅ Class 1 (Positive)
🎓 Learning Outcome

This project helps in understanding:
🧠 Logistic Regression fundamentals

🔄 Gradient Descent optimization

🏗️ Building ML models without libraries
